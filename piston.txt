In-line engine The simplest and most common type of engine comprises four vertical cylinders close together in a row. This is known as an in-line engine . Cars with capacities exceeding 2,000cc often have six cylinders in line. V engine The more compact V-engine is fitted in some cars, especially vehicles with eight or 12 cylinders, and also some with six cylinders. Here the cylinders are arranged opposite each other at an angle of up to 90 degrees. Flat engine Some engines have horizontally opposed cylinders . They are an extension of the V-engine, the angle having been widened to 180 degrees. The advantages lie in saving height and also in certain aspects of balance. The cylinders in which the pistons operate are cast into the block, as are mountings for ancillary equipment such as a filter for the oil which lubricates the engine, and a pump for the fuel. An oil reservoir , called the sump , is bolted underneath the crankcase .
